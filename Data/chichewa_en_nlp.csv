102,PUBLIC STATEMENT ON THE FUTURE OF MALAWI LEADERSHIP
103,Introduction
104,"Fellow Malawians, it is with great conviction and patriotism for my country, that I have decided to speak on issues that are affecting us all. I say conviction and patriotism for my country because in taking this stand, I am well aware of the associated risks to me personally, my family and my colleagues. However, my personal comfort plays subordinate to the national good. It is on that basis that I have braved to make this statement."
105,"I am inspired by the many brave Malawians who have come before me. From the time of Reverend John Chilembwe to Dr. Kamuzu Banda, who fought against a white establishment for us to attain political independence. I am inspired by the likes of Dr. Bakili Muluzi, late Chakufwa Chihana, late Aleke Banda and all those who braved the one-party system in the early 1990s for us to have democracy. These Malawians knew the risks so well but put the interest of the nation far ahead of their personal interests. If it were not for their sacrifices, perhaps we would until today be under colonial rule or under one-party system. This statement I am making is a fruit of their sacrifices. I am personally indebted to them all."
106,"Malawi is a country well-endowed with natural resources and a predominantly youthful and energetic human resource which unfortunately is currently under- utilized. Malawi has everything required for her people to economically develop except it lacks effective leadership. Our development challenges have remained the same. Economic growth rate remains low, children still learn under a tree, health facilities are poorly resourced, some people have yet to have access to safe drinking water, agriculture is largely rain-fed and subsistence, markets for agricultural produce are weak and unpredictable, few people own houses in urban areas and only few houses in rural areas are permanent, transport system is inefficient and expensive, university students from low income households continue to face the risk of withdrawal on account of lack of tuition fee or upkeep expenses, small and medium enterprises cannot grow because the business environment is less conducive and some districts have yet to have tarmac road until now."
107,"In fact, if one reads the priorities in the 1965 Nyasaland Development Plan and compare with priorities in the Statement of Development Policies in 1970s to mid- 1990s, then read Vision 2020 and then read Malawi 2063, it is clear that our priorities have remained the same. The reason they have remained the same is because they remain challenges because we have not made noticeable improvement as a country. The reason they remain challenges is because no leadership has addressed any key priority exhaustively. We still discuss food insecurity. We still discuss poor access to safe drinking water. We still discuss lack of all-weather roads in some areas. We still discuss poor access to electricity. We still discuss lack of profitable markets for farmers. We still discuss high unemployment especially among the youth."
108,Economy
109,"Fellow Malawians, our economy remains small, vulnerable to shocks and we continue carrying the Least Developed Country label. Even more irritating is that countries which have been at war or in conflict have economies stronger than ours. The weak economy we have is not the make of nature. It is the make of our leaders. While acknowledging periods of progress, such periods have been episodic and short-lived."
110,"Malawi has capacity to feed itself and other countries given its abundant water resources for irrigation. Malawi has capacity to substitute imports and to increase exports and in so doing improve her balance of payments, stabilize exchange rate and contain inflation rate. Malawi has capacity to manage its own budget without heavy borrowing."
111,"Sadly, people we have put in position of power to advance our common interests have opted to pursue personal interests, maintain luxuries and perpetuate the status quo at the expense of common Malawians whom they are meant to serve. There is both outright impunity and institutionalized impunity. An example of institutionalized impunity is the heaping of allowance entitlements to cabinet members and senior government officers when middle and junior level officers continue earning low salaries."
112,We have a system which just fuel allowance entitlement of a cabinet member is worth more than a salary of a Principal Secretary and fuel allowance entitlement of a Principal Secretary is worth more than a salary of a middle level officer. The same is the case in state owned enterprises.
113,"I stand with you; teachers, police officers, healthcare workers, agriculture extension workers and many others whose salary is a fraction of just one allowance entitlement of a senior public officer and a minister. Surely, this is institutionalized impunity and must stop."
114,"I stand with you parents whose children are learning under a tree. I stand with you families who are struggling to put food on the table. I stand with you families whose sick relatives are sent back from hospital without receiving treatment. I stand with you, university students, who are struggling to meet upkeep expenses. I stand with you who are looking for a job which you are not able to find. I stand with you farmers who have been at subsistence level without hope of growing to a higher level. Your next government will stand with you. It will be a government whose job is to offer solutions and will address the challenges you are facing. You can count on me."
115,"Fellow Malawians, I believe in the potential of our country and in Malawians. We read positive stories about economic success of Rwanda. Zambia has just changed narrative since their current government came in office later than our current government and we are hearing positive stories. There is no reason other than poor leadership, that stories for Malawi that make international news headlines are poverty, hunger and corruption involving high profile public officers."
116,"I feel the pain we are all going through in the tough economic times. I acknowledge that part of the reasons for the economic challenges are external factors such as a war in Ukraine and tropical cyclones. However, as I have said time and again in various media interviews, the external factors have just contributed. A large part of the challenges is our own making. The past national budgets by the current political administration were poorly prepared, not transformative and did not build foundation for macroeconomic stability. I said it in 2020 and have consistently said this. The problems we are going through were anticipated and I did not keep quiet, I shared my views then."
117,"The fast-rising public debt is testimony of lack of fiscal discipline. We were reminded a month ago that every Malawian is carrying on our shoulders a debt burden of K600,000. Unfortunately, this is not debt that financed programs to improve the living standard of us all. This is debt that financed corruption and luxury of senior officers. There has been limited interest to reform the fiscal plan – to remove or reduce unnecessary expenditure items and to grow the revenue base by increasing resource allocation to productive sectors. Additionally, there has been high level inefficiency in government resulting in delays to approve projects. The State President himself and some ministers have admitted this in public. Delay to approve projects locks up foreign exchange since most projects are donor- funded, delays job opportunities and delays development outcomes. These are the main reasons we are going through difficult times. If the leadership was up to task, the extent of suffering would be less than is the case."
118,"My colleagues and I come to offer genuine transformation. Malawi is a natural resource-rich and labour-abundant economy. Our economic policy will revolve around maximizing the potential in agriculture, mining, tourism and developing the human resource both in its own right and as catalysts for manufacturing. This will be done while progressively moving towards a knowledge economy by investing in science and technology."
119,"I will implement Malawi 2063 in its entirety. I am happy to inform you, fellow Malawians, that Malawi 2063 is a document I intimately subscribe to, because I was one of the reviewers. I also co-reviewed the enabler on enhanced public sector performance in the Malawi 2063 first 10 years Implementation Plan. My being identified as a person who could review this enabler is testimony that I understand the public service and I know how to make it perform. When I say I will implement it fully, I know what is in the document and I have adequate passion to implement it. I emphasize I because the responsibility for implementing a strategic plan in any organization is vested in the head of the organization. What makes a strategy work for one organization and fail for the other organization, is the quality of leadership of the organization. I will provide quality leadership."
120,"We will transform agriculture through Mega farms and cooperatives which will facilitate mechanization, improve productivity, promote access to reliable markets for farmers, catalyze industrialization and urbanization. We will embark on infrastructure revolution agenda. From electricity generation, transport and ICT to residential and government office buildings."
121,"We will decisively support micro, small and medium enterprises. We will identify those which Malawi has comparative and competitive advantage to produce and have niche markets in the region and prioritize support to them. One key performance indicator for the Ministry of Industrialization and Trade will be the number of micro-scale enterprises graduating into small-scale; the number of small-scale enterprises graduating into medium-scale; the number of medium-scale graduating into large-scale annually. We will encourage and support Malawian large-scale enterprises to become multinational corporations. We denounce the glorification of the MSME concept as if that is the ideal destiny for them. They will be helped to grow."
122,"There are four main ways in which a country can benefit from its extractive resources which include mining. These are i) royalties, ii) resource rent iii) State participation and iv) taxes. So far, the component of State participation has not been exploited despite being the most beneficial way. To maximize benefits from mining, government will establish a Mining Company that will be getting into Joint Venture arrangement with foreign companies. Joint Venture arrangements will enable Malawians to be in management team and in the Board of Directors, thereby directly participating in running mining business and curb transfer pricing and other forms of illicit financial flows that often happen in mining industry. Your next government will review tax incentives to ensure Malawians get a fair share of their natural resources."
123,"We will approach tourism holistically and contextually. Tourism is about attraction. We will invest in areas that are unique to Malawi, one of them is establishing vibrant cultural centers and packaging our history into a commercial product. Tourism is a beneficiary of derived demand. Our resolve to develop the economy, develop manufacturing sector will positively contribute to the travel and tourism industry. We will make Malawi a destination for citizens of neighboring countries to come and shop. As they come, they will need accommodation and transport just as Malawians do when they travel outside."
124,"Agriculture transformation, infrastructure revolution, growing of MSMEs, mining, industrialization (manufacturing) and tourism will anchor our job creation agenda."
125,"My fellow Malawians, I am aware of the key drivers of cost of living. We will overhaul the fuel procurement system in the short-term while investing in cost- effective mode of transport such as rail and pipeline in line with the Malawi National Transport Master Plan. We will review all levies and remove or reduce those that can be done so without compromising public service delivery. We will work to achieve macroeconomic stability with a stable and relatively strong currency to contain imported inflation. In line with Malawi 2063, we will enhance agricultural productivity so that price of food is cheap while farmers still make profit."
126,We will embark on an ambitious home ownership program in which Malawi Housing Corporation will be recapitalized so it can build houses of different designs to suit your affordability. You will be paying monthly rental fee but which will be going towards purchase of the house. We will make home ownership easy for everyone. A well-thought housing scheme will be implemented in rural areas.
127,"My fellow Malawians, our approach to improving living standards focuses on containing cost of living on one hand and improving incomes on the other hand while investing in physical and human capital development to put a solid foundation for economic development. That is what your next government will do."
128,"Public debt management will be key in getting the economy back on right track. Our resolve to decisively end corruption will free up resources and reduce the need for borrowing. Estimates based on previous government financial audits showed that 30% of the national budget is unaccounted for. When the system is fixed, we will save these funds and spend on intended projects. Our resolve to reform the fiscal plan so we remove unnecessary expenditure and we grow revenue base will reduce the need for borrowing. Reform of foreign missions will free up resources. Where we will have to borrow for legitimate reasons, these questions will guide in determining the source of borrowing; 1) will the loan help grow economy (GDP)? 2) will the loan help either grow tax revenue or reduce expenditure or both? 3) will the loan help grow exports? If the answer is NO especially to 2 and 3, no external loan will be contracted. If a loan still has to be secured, it will be domestic and using a long-term development bond."
129,"Reducing debt will feed into stimulating private sector development as commercial banks and other lenders will have enough liquidity to lend to private sector at competitive interest rates. Your next government will commit to clearing payment arrears as one way of capacitating private sector to operate fully, expand production and create additional jobs."
130,Corruption
131,"Corruption is a developmental challenge. It is a political campaign issue. Every leader promises to end corruption during political campaign yet corruption continues to worsen. Recent revelations of corruption are evident that our leaders are not only failing to end corruption, they are in fact participating in it."
132,"A large part of our poverty is due to corruption. We have had leaders who amass wealth for themselves through corruption and morally questionable entitlements and give us leftovers. Citizens have systematically been economically disempowered so we can depend on them. They use the same corruptly acquired wealth, stolen from the many taxes we pay, to coax us to side with them when they are caught on the wrong side of the law. They project a picture that any criminal investigation in their dealings is the work of their political rivals. We fight on their behalf even when they were the first to kill us through denying us access to education, healthcare, food and job and business opportunities."
133,"Malawi has enough financial resources to deliver public services adequately. Publicly available information confirm that it is possible to run a government without heavy borrowing. For example, it is alleged that in one contract, a business person charged government US$10,524,000 for goods that cost the business person US$2,165,700 making abnormal profit of US$8,358,300. Surely this is over- pricing and stealing from poor Malawians."
134,"Fellow Malawians, we all can see that the main problem in Malawi is not inadequate resources but corruption and excessive and expensive entitlements of senior public officers. Fighting corruption must be a top priority for a government. That is not the case unfortunately. Some of the reasons corruption is not ending include the expensive type of political campaign and the parasitic political party system. Statistics confirm that Malawi is a least developed country hence it is a country whose people are poor and by extension, a country whose politicians are poor. The type of political campaign that is practiced is expensive and breeds a fertile ground for advance State capture by those who bankroll the campaign. Corrupt business
people finance greedy politicians in anticipation of easy access to business contracts once the politician or political party is in power. This is what has sustained State capture."
135,"In State capture, the loser is the citizenry. Politicians influence award of government contracts to corrupt business people at inflated prices. The inflated prices are because the corrupt business people want to i) recover the money they spent to bankroll campaign, ii) sell the goods and services at a profit and iii) give part of the payment to the politicians so they remain connected. When the politicians get part of the payment they use part of the money for their personal projects and part of it for campaign materials and other political expenses. That is why the fight against corruption cannot be won if we continue using the same political campaign model. In fact, there are politicians who have established businesses out of money acquired in this way. Their businesses get contracts from the same government they stole capital from. In other words, our tax money has become business capital for greedy politicians and the businesses get contracts from government where they are paid by our tax money again. This is the height of impunity in Malawi. We all have a responsibility to stop this."
136,"My fellow Malawians, let me illustrate how corruption causes poverty. Suppose there was money enough to construct three school blocks but due to corruption the price is inflated and the money can only construct two school blocks. Suppose each school block has two classrooms that can accommodate 60 learners. Further, suppose constructing a school block offers job opportunity to ten people as bricklayers, carpenters and others. By constructing two instead of three school blocks because of inflated prices, the results are as follows"
137,"Three blocks would have made 360 learners move from learning under a tree to a proper classroom, but due to corruption only 240 learners will be in a good classroom. The other 120 learners will continue learning under a tree yet money was available to put them in a good classroom."
138,"Constructing three school blocks would create employment opportunities to 30 people. By constructing two, it means 10 people who would have some work to do still have no job."
139,"Since there is corruption, there is high likelihood that the two school blocks may be of substandard quality. They may need maintenance quicker than if construction was not marred with corruption. Additional resources are likely to be spent to rehabilitate the same school blocks when the resources would have been spent on other functions."
140,If children are learning under a tree; if there are no drugs in health facilities; if there are no all-weather roads in some areas; if jobs are scarce; if we Malawians are poor; one of the main causes is corruption.
141,"Our approach to the fight against corruption starts from the process of getting into office. We will not do the traditional political campaign you have known. We will not do because we do not want to get money from corrupt business people so that when you vote us into office we serve them instead of serving you, Malawians."
142,"We will not form a political party because it is an expensive organization that contributes to temptation of political leaders to indulge in corruption and when in office, abuse public resources to fund the political party. You can relate this to some of the revelations that are coming out now of how public institutions financed activities of a political party. We do not want to tie ourselves to the yokes that have chained the others. More importantly, not forming a political party means that there will be no group of people (members of the ruling party) that feels and behaves as more important than the rest of Malawians. Between me and the public service, there will be no person or group of people to terrorize public servants on the premise that they are the ruling party members."
143,"It is not an exaggeration to say that political parties have been a disuniting factor so far in Malawi as they have been catalyst for tribalism and nepotism. You may appreciate the observation that in some political parties, it does not matter how loyal and qualified a member is, if they do not come from a particular region or from a particular tribe they cannot be voted president of a party to have a chance to contest as president of a country. We must for a moment dismantle this construct and create a political system that gives hope to every Malawian everywhere that they can be anything including President of Malawi if they work hard, have qualifications and have the integrity to serve their nation. I am convinced that being a president without a political party will foster nation building."
144,"Additionally, as your leader, I will have all my focus on running government, rather than divide my focus between running government on one hand and running a political party on the other hand."
145,"Fighting corruption is a war. Being a war, it needs troops who are loyal to their nation, troops who are well-trained and well-resourced. Above all, troops who are best commanded. The agencies responsible for fighting corruption are the troops. The President is the commander. Like in a military war, if troops are compromised, it is difficult to win the fight against corruption. If the commander is compromised, it is impossible to win the fight against corruption."
146,"For the reason that we will not get into office through a corrupt process, you can be assured that my team and I will fight against corruption decisively for we will not be haunted by our own involvement in the same. I will take it my prime responsibility that the fight against corruption is ably commanded and that if there are elements of compromised loyalty in the troops, I take corrective measures. I can guarantee that under my stewardship, no effort will be spared to fight corruption."
147,The future of Malawi leadership
148,"Fellow Malawians, I understand the frustration among well-meaning Malawians. I am aware that some of you have lost interest in voting in next election because we have been disappointed by the political administrations we have had. I come to give hope. I come to restore the courage we always have had, believing that as citizens, power is in our hands to make a leadership that has i) integrity, ii) technical and administrative competence and iii) desire to serve."
149,The 2025 presidential election will be a ‘referendum’ - a choice between maintaining impunity versus ending impunity; a choice between maintaining mediocrity versus a launch of meritocracy; a choice between politicians versus leaders.
150,"To echo the words of Barack Obama, former President of the USA, “we did not inherit the country from our ancestors so we can feel a sense of entitlement, rather we borrowed it from our children and the generations to come and therefore we have an obligation to hand over a better country to them”."
151,"We have a responsibility to change the narrative that politics is for the few rich Malawians more so those getting rich through corruption and theft of public resources. We have a duty to change the narrative that politics is for crooks, liars, the incompetent and that politics is risky."
152,"My colleagues and I are at your service and are determined to make personal sacrifices for the sake of presenting a real choice to you in the next elections. We come so that as voters you are not faced with a choice between lemons and grapefruits (manyumwa), for both are sour. We come to be your real choice. We know the contenders are heavily armoured with resources, including those they stole from our taxes."
153,"We are armoured with faith. We believe we shall succeed with your support. We are ready to govern and to do so competently. I have the right training, experience and exposure to public policy to competently develop the economy and run the public service. As you may appreciate, the duty of any government is two-fold; i) to develop the economy with the aim of improving people’s living standards and ii) to manage the public service so it can deliver public goods and services to people professionally, efficiently and effectively. I promise to deliver on these two cardinal roles in an excellent manner."
154,"I appeal to you Malawians to support my candidacy. I am ready to serve you. In a special way, I encourage the youth to take 2025 election as uniquely important for I, one of their own, will be on the ballot paper. I am going to run the government in ways that will prove that the youth in Malawi are ready for the task. I will take it my additional responsibility to bring public confidence in the youth and in doing so clear a way for all youth who seek elected positions. I promise a government that will be at your service. I promise an administration that will be the moral campass of the nation."
155,"Let us together make 2025 election a turning point for Malawi. Let us together uproot the breed of corrupt, incompetent and nepotistic politicians and plant a new breed of leaders that will be a symbol of integrity, competence and service. As late Lee Kuan Yew, founding Prime Minister of Singapore said, “we need the best and ablest in politics, not charlatans with a gift of the gab”. Let us together sanitize politics in Malawi. Politics will become clean when clean people replace the dirty ones who have made it dirty."
156,"I am appealing to every Malawian to engage our conscience and think of a Malawi we would want our children and grandchildren to live in. It does not matter what our current position is, what matters is the responsibility we have to ensure we hand over a better country to our children and grandchildren. You may be a serving member of the cabinet, an advisor, a senior public officer, a political party member who genuinely believes things are not the way you would have wanted to serve the nation.
