en: PUBLIC STATEMENT ON THE FUTURE OF MALAWI LEADERSHIP,ny: UTHENGA KWA FUKO LA MALAWI PA TSOGOLO LA UTSOGOLERI WA DZIKO
en: Introduction,ny: Mawu oyamba
"en: Fellow Malawians, it is with great conviction and patriotism for my country, that I have decided to speak on issues that are affecting us all. I say conviction and patriotism for my country because in taking this stand, I am well aware of the associated risks to me personally, my family and my colleagues. However, my personal comfort plays subordinate to the national good. It is on that basis that I have braved to make this statement.","ny: A Malawi anzanga, zanditengera kutsutsika mu mtima ndi kukonda dziko lathu, kuti ndilankhule nanu pa nkhani zomwe zikutikhudza tonse. Ndikunena kuti kutsutsika mu mtima ndi kukonda dziko lathu chifukwa pochita izi, ndikudziwa bwino za zoopsa zomwe zingabwere kwa ine, a pa banja anga komanso anzanga. Komatu ine ndimakhulupirira kuti umtambasale wanga usamakhale wofunika koposa ubwino wa fuko la Malawi. Ndi ganizo limeneri, ndalimba mtima kuti ndiyankhule."
"en: I am inspired by the many brave Malawians who have come before me. From the time of Reverend John Chilembwe to Dr. Kamuzu Banda, who fought against a white establishment for us to attain political independence. I am inspired by the likes of Dr. Bakili Muluzi, late Chakufwa Chihana, late Aleke Banda and all those who braved the one-party system in the early 1990s for us to have democracy. These Malawians knew the risks so well but put the interest of the nation far ahead of their personal interests. If it were not for their sacrifices, perhaps we would until today be under colonial rule or under one-party system. This statement I am making is a fruit of their sacrifices. I am personally indebted to them all.","ny: Ndine olimbikitsidwa ndi aMalawi ambiri olimba mtima omwe adatenga mbali zaka zapitazo. Kuyambira nthawi ya m'busa John Chilembwe mpaka Dr. Kamuzu Banda, omwe adalimbana ndi ulamuliro wa azungu kuti tipeze ufulu wodzilamulira. Ndine olimbikitsidwa ndi omwe adalimba mtima kulimbana ndi ulamuliro wa chipani chimodzi kuti tikhale ndi demokalase. Awa ndi monga Dr. Bakili Muluzi, malemu Chakufwa Chihana, malemu Aleke Banda ndi ena ambiri. AMalawi amenewa ankadziwa mavuto obwera chifukwa chotenga mbali posintha ndale koma adaika zofuna za dziko patsogolo. Pakadapanda kudzipereka kotere, mwina mpaka lero tikanakhala pansi pa ulamuliro wachitsamunda kapena pansi pa ulamuliro wa chipani chimodzi. Ineyo kukhala ndi mwai wokuyankhulani ndi chipatso cha ntchito imene anthu amenewa adagwira. Ndine wothokoza kwa makolo athu amenewa."
"en: Malawi is a country well-endowed with natural resources and a predominantly youthful and energetic human resource which unfortunately is currently under- utilized. Malawi has everything required for her people to economically develop except it lacks effective leadership. Our development challenges have remained the same. Economic growth rate remains low, children still learn under a tree, health facilities are poorly resourced, some people have yet to have access to safe drinking water, agriculture is largely rain-fed and subsistence, markets for agricultural produce are weak and unpredictable, few people own houses in urban areas and only few houses in rural areas are permanent, transport system is inefficient and expensive, university students from low income households continue to face the risk of withdrawal on account of lack of tuition fee or upkeep expenses, small and medium enterprises cannot grow because the business environment is less conducive and some districts have yet to have tarmac road until now.","ny: Dziko la Malawi liri ndi zonse zofunika kuti anthu ake atukuke pachuma kupatula kuti tiribe utsogoleri wodziwa ntchito, wa ngwiro ndi wotumikira nzika zake. Ana a sukulu akuphunzirabe pansi pa mitengo. Zipatala zilibe mankhwala ndi zipangizo zokwanira. Madera ena anthu akumwa madzi oyipa. Ulimi siwukutukuka. Alimi alibe misika yogula pa mtengo wopereka phindu ku zokolola zawo. Anthu ambiri wokhala mmizinda ndi ma matauni amakhala nyumba za eni zolipira. Mtengo wa minibus kupita ku ntchito ndi ku bizinezi ndi wokwera kwambiri. Wophunzira ena ku university sakumaliza maphunziro awo chifukwa chosowa ndalama za fizi komanso kugula chakudya. Mabizinezi ang’ono ang’ono akulephera kukula chifukwa malonda sakuyenda. Madera ena mpaka pano, zake 58 tikudzilamulira tokha, sadakhale ndi nseu wa phula."
"en: In fact, if one reads the priorities in the 1965 Nyasaland Development Plan and compare with priorities in the Statement of Development Policies in 1970s to mid- 1990s, then read Vision 2020 and then read Malawi 2063, it is clear that our priorities have remained the same. The reason they have remained the same is because they remain challenges because we have not made noticeable improvement as a country. The reason they remain challenges is because no leadership has addressed any key priority exhaustively. We still discuss food insecurity. We still discuss poor access to safe drinking water. We still discuss lack of all-weather roads in some areas. We still discuss poor access to electricity. We still discuss lack of profitable markets for farmers. We still discuss high unemployment especially among the youth.","ny: Ndondomeko za chitukuko kuyambira pamene tidalandira ufulu wodzilamulira kufika pano zakhala zikukamba zinthu zimodzimodzi zoyenera kuchita. Chifukwa chokambira zinthu zimodzimodzi ndi chifukwa zinthuzo zikanali mavuto amene tikukumana nawo. Palibe utsogoleri umene udabwera nkuthetsa vuto motheratu. Mfundo zathu za chitukuko zimakambabe zothetsa njala, zobweretsa madzi akumwa, za kukonza misewu, kuchepa ndi kuzimazima kwa magetsi, kusowa kwa misika yodalirika ndi yogula pa mtengo wabwino kwa alimi komanso tikadalimbana ndi ulova kwenikweni kwa achinyamata."
en: Economy,ny: Chuma
"en: Fellow Malawians, our economy remains small, vulnerable to shocks and we continue carrying the Least Developed Country label. Even more irritating is that countries which have been at war or in conflict have economies stronger than ours. The weak economy we have is not the make of nature. It is the make of our leaders. While acknowledging periods of progress, such periods have been episodic and short-lived.","ny: A Malawi anzanga, dziko lathu likadali mu gulu la maiko osaukitsitsa pa dziko lapansi. Chokhumudwitsa kwambiri n’chakuti mayiko amene akhala ali pa nkhondo kapena pamikangano ali ndi chuma champhamvu kuposa chathu. Chuma chofooka chomwe tili nacho sichinthu chachilengedwe.

Kwa nthawi yayitali mu ufulu odzilamulira tokha chuma chathu chakula monyentchere."
"en: Malawi has capacity to feed itself and other countries given its abundant water resources for irrigation. Malawi has capacity to substitute imports and to increase exports and in so doing improve her balance of payments, stabilize exchange rate and contain inflation rate. Malawi has capacity to manage its own budget without heavy borrowing.","ny: Dziko la Malawi liri ndi kuthekera kodzidyetsa lokha komanso kudyetsa maiko ena. Dziko la Malawi liri ndi kuthekera kopanga katundu wambiri lokha ndikuchepetsa katundu wogula kunja, potero ndikuthandiza kuti ndalama zakunja zomwe timapeza ndi ndalama za kunja zimene timazifuna zidzikwanirana.

"en: The fast-rising public debt is testimony of lack of fiscal discipline. We were reminded a month ago that every Malawian is carrying on our shoulders a debt burden of K600,000. Unfortunately, this is not debt that financed programs to improve the living standard of us all. This is debt that financed corruption and luxury of senior officers. There has been limited interest to reform the fiscal plan – to remove or reduce unnecessary expenditure items and to grow the revenue base by increasing resource allocation to productive sectors. Additionally, there has been high level inefficiency in government resulting in delays to approve projects. The State President himself and some ministers have admitted this in public. Delay to approve projects locks up foreign exchange since most projects are donor- funded, delays job opportunities and delays development outcomes. These are the main reasons we are going through difficult times. If the leadership was up to task, the extent of suffering would be less than is the case.","ny: Kuchuluka monyanya kwa ngongole zaboma ndi umboni wakuti boma likungotenga ngongole mwa chisawawa.

Fighting corruption must be a top priority for a government. That is not the case unfortunately. Some of the reasons corruption is not ending include the expensive type of political campaign and the parasitic political party system. Statistics confirm that Malawi is a least developed country hence it is a country whose people are poor and by extension, a country whose politicians are poor. The type of political campaign that is practiced is expensive and breeds a fertile ground for advance State capture by those who bankroll the campaign. Corrupt business
people finance greedy politicians in anticipation of easy access to business contracts once the politician or political party is in power. This is what has sustained State capture.","ny: A Malawi anzanga, kuti tipite patsogolo ngati dziko, tiyambe tathetsa katangale. Koma chifukwa chiyani katangale sakutha?

"en: In State capture, the loser is the citizenry. Politicians influence award of government contracts to corrupt business people at inflated prices. The inflated prices are because the corrupt business people want to i) recover the money they spent to bankroll campaign, ii) sell the goods and services at a profit and iii) give part of the payment to the politicians so they remain connected. When the politicians get part of the payment they use part of the money for their personal projects and part of it for campaign materials and other political expenses. That is why the fight against corruption cannot be won if we continue using the same political campaign model. In fact, there are politicians who have established businesses out of money acquired in this way. Their businesses get contracts from the same government they stole capital from. In other words, our tax money has become business capital for greedy politicians and the businesses get contracts from government where they are paid by our tax money again. This is the height of impunity in Malawi. We all have a responsibility to stop this.","ny: A ndale akalandira ndalama kwa khuluku wa bizinezi amene walipidwa ndi misonkho yathu, iwo amayambitsa ma kampani amene amaphangiranso mwai wa bizinezi ku boma.

"en: My fellow Malawians, let me illustrate how corruption causes poverty. Suppose there was money enough to construct three school blocks but due to corruption the price is inflated and the money can only construct two school blocks. Suppose each school block has two classrooms that can accommodate 60 learners. Further, suppose constructing a school block offers job opportunity to ten people as bricklayers, carpenters and others. By constructing two instead of three school blocks because of inflated prices, the results are as follows","ny: AMalawi anzanga, ndiloleni ndikufotokozereni mmene ziphuphu zimabweretsera umphawi.

They may need maintenance quicker than if construction was not marred with corruption. Additional resources are likely to be spent to rehabilitate the same school blocks when the resources would have been spent on other functions.","ny: Popeza pali katangale, pali chiopsezo kuti midadada ya sukulu ziwirizi ikhala yosalimba.

"en: We will not form a political party because it is an expensive organization that contributes to temptation of political leaders to indulge in corruption and when in office, abuse public resources to fund the political party. You can relate this to some of the revelations that are coming out now of how public institutions financed activities of a political party. We do not want to tie ourselves to the yokes that have chained the others. More importantly, not forming a political party means that there will be no group of people (members of the ruling party) that feels and behaves as more important than the rest of Malawians. Between me and the public service, there will be no person or group of people to terrorize public servants on the premise that they are the ruling party members.","ny: Sitipanga chipani cha ndale chifukwa ndi chinthu chofuna ndalama zambiri chimene chimapangitsa kuti atsogoleri andale akopeke ndi katangale ndipo akakhala paudindo amawononga chuma chaboma popereka ndalama ku zipani.

"en: It is not an exaggeration to say that political parties have been a disuniting factor so far in Malawi as they have been catalyst for tribalism and nepotism. You may appreciate the observation that in some political parties, it does not matter how loyal and qualified a member is, if they do not come from a particular region or from a particular tribe they cannot be voted president of a party to have a chance to contest as president of a country. We must for a moment dismantle this construct and create a political system that gives hope to every Malawian everywhere that they can be anything including President of Malawi if they work hard, have qualifications and have the integrity to serve their nation. I am convinced that being a president without a political party will foster nation building.","ny: Ndikukhulupirira kuti mugwirizana nane kuti zipani zakhala gawo limodzi lolimbikitsa tsankho potengera chigawo chochokera ndi mtundu.

The agencies responsible for fighting corruption are the troops. The President is the commander.
